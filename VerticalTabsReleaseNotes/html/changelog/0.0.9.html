	<h2 class="heading">Vertical Tabs Release Notes  - 0.0.9</h2>
	<h3>Minor adaptation + Extensions</h3>
	<p>Several small bugs were solved and performance was tweaked. <br/>
	Additionally more extensions possibility were added, in order to be able to add language specific functionalities. So far they are used by ABAP language only, but if you have any ideas for any of the programming language, please create an issue on the project Github page</p>

	<h3>ABAP Language Feature - 0.0.4</h3>
	<p>In default, currently for the ABAP and SAP GUI tabs, beside the object name, description is displayed next to it. When available, description is also used during filtering of the entries. This behaviour can be switched off in Preferences.</p>
