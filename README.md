What is working:
- Sorting -> manual (drag & drop), by project, by name, editor ID
- Pin tab - even if editor is closed the tab will not disappear from the view and on press the editor will be re-opened
- saving sorting at close of eclipse
- grouping like in Edge cards and restoring groups at startup
- renaming of groups and tabs
- filtering by text, dirty state or linked project
